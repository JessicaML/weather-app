# Task: Frontend Engineering Challenge

## Context
You are a senior member of a team tasked with developing the web front-end of a new, intelligent weather forecasting service.

The application should use the OpenWeatherMap API. (Can sign up for free: https://openweathermap.org/api, if you have any issues with this an alternative weather API can be used e.g. https://open-meteo.com/ ).

Users must be able to provide their location, and see at least the current weather, temperature, sunrise and sunset times.

This should be developed in React, using Typescript and tested using React testing library.

Detailed tests are not needed, but 1 or 2 to demonstrate the setup approach should be in place.

The site is expected to be accessed primarily by mobile devices but should support all major browsers.


## Challenge
- Build and host (locally or elsewhere) a React using TS web application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display current weather information for a user-entered location.
- The information shown must include: current weather, temperature, sunrise and sunset times.
- Include at least 1 unit test
- This should be an ‘MVP’ version, and any further extensions you’d like to make can be talked through during the interview and do not need to be implemented.
